📦 BankAccount Java Project
This Java project simulates a simple bank account system using object-oriented programming principles, especially encapsulation.

💡 Features:
Create a bank account with an initial balance and password.

Securely check balance by verifying the password.

Deposit funds after password validation.

Withdraw funds (only if sufficient balance is available and password is correct).

🔒 Security:
All account operations are password-protected.

The balance and password fields are private and only accessed through public methods, demonstrating encapsulation.

📁 Structure:
BankAccount.java: Contains the logic for creating and managing a bank account.

TestprojectBank.java: A test class with a console-based interface that allows users to interact with the account.

✅ How to Run:
Compile both .java files.

Run TestprojectBank.java and follow the prompts in the console.
